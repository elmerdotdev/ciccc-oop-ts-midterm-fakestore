# OOP & TS - Midterm

## ‚öΩÔ∏è Objective

Create a fake store website using OOP. You will create the necessary classes and methods needed to make a working shop. The file structure has already been provided but you are free to customize this by adding new files/components if needed.

**API:** [https://fakestoreapi.com/products]

## üìñ Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the node packages by running `npm install` on your terminal.
3. Plan and design how your shop will look like. The main focus of this project is functionality so it's okay if your shop doesn't have the best design, as long as it's clean and user-friendly.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start you live server.
5. Commit and push your changes once you are done.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Show a list of products from an API, with image, title, price and description
- Be able to add products to the cart
- Be able to change the quantity of each item in the cart
- Be able to remove items from the cart
- Show the total number of items in the cart
- Show the total price of the items in the cart

## üî£ Methods

You need to modify your `CartContext.js` file to include methods such as:

- `addProduct(product)`
- `updateQuantity(id)`
- `removeProduct(id)`

## üóíÔ∏è Notes

- Place your CSS code inside the `style.css` file.
- You can customize the file structure if you like. Just make sure to create one file per class/component.
- Although functionality is the priority, your shop still needs to be responsive as always.

Good luck!
